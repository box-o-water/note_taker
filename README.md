## Description

A note taker app, deployed to Heroku, using an Express.js back end. Starter code was provided. Much of the remaining code was pulled directly from bootcamp class examples. The challenge for me was to troubleshoot file structure and pathing to get all functionality to work, without modifying the starter code.
